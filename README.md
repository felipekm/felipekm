### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

I have been working in the software industry since 2005 and remotely since 2018. I am the proud son of a programmer who became passionate about new technologies and the latest techniques for crafting software over the years.

I consider myself a challenge-driven professional who understands the importance of all project aspects, using the acquired experience to deliver reasonable resolutions, with a broad background and experience developing Web applications, Web servers (monoliths), Microservices, APIs, non-relational and relational Databases, Continuous Integration, and Continuous Delivery. All this experience comes from a wide range of practical projects.

I love people and have experience leading remotely distributed teams using Agile, SCRUM, and Kanban (Jira, Zenhub, GitHub issues). I'm constantly pushing myself to create a collaborative and supportive environment.
