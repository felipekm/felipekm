### Hello there ðŸ‘‹

Iâ€™ve been in the software industry since 2005 and working remotely since 2018. Growing up as son of a programmer sparked my early fascination with computers before I completed 7 years in the 90s. Basically, 
I am passionate about new technologies and building robust software, and as a challenge-driven professional, I apply my extensive experience in Web applications, Web servers, Microservices, APIs, Databases, and CI/CD pipelines to deliver effective solutions. 

My work spans diverse projects, emphasizing a holistic approach to development.
I also have a strong background in leading remote teams using Agile methodologies (SCRUM, Kanban) and tools like Jira, Zenhub, and GitHub issues, fostering collaborative environments that drive success.
